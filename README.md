Colour Recognition App.

This project is a color recognition application that uses OpenCV and Tkinter to capture live video from a webcam and display the BGR and HSV values of the clicked point in the video feed.


Features:

Live Video Feed: Captures and displays live video from the webcam.
Color Detection: Provides the BGR and HSV values of a clicked point in the video frame.
Contour Highlighting: Highlights areas of the video frame that match the selected color.


Libraries Used:

OpenCV: For video capture, frame processing, and color conversion.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
Pillow: For handling image data within the Tkinter canvas.
